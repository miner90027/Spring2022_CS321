# Shell program demonstrating some system admin commands

# 1) Use the command 'chmod' to modify the permissions to files & directories for owner, group, & others.
#	Create a shell script & give the current user full permission and everyone else read & execute permissions only.



# 2) Create a FAT, NTFS, and EXT3 filesystem in your linux box. Mount it in three seperate sub-directories inside /mnt/.



# 3) Use teh 'df' command to test it.



# 4) Now create three different users called 'testuser1', 'testuser2', & 'testuser3'.



# 5) Create a group called 'myfsusser'



# 6) Add all three of the users created to the group.



# 7) Set the permission of the directory created so that only members of the group can access it.



# 8) Write a program that will check if the current user has write permission to the directory created.
#	Print results.



# 9) Now modiify the '~./bashrc' file so that the yser will automatically get the message right after login.
